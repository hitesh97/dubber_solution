# Purpose

The Lottery Programming Challenge is a challenge for you to demonstrate that you can write a simple program in any language of your choice (e.g. C#, Javascript, Java, Python).

This isn’t a real application: it’s a chance for you to demonstrate coding techniques and patterns which we’ll discuss in the interview. So, if there’s a technique you’re interested in, include it.

If you have time, show off a little, but it’s much better to have a simple application which works with clean, readable code then a more complicated version that doesn’t work.

Good luck!

# The Challenge

You must write a simple lottery number generator to choose 6 unique numbers randomly between 1 to 49 inclusive and display them to the user.

# Rules

1. The program must have a user interface. This can be a console application, desktop application, a web page or a phone app - it's up to you.
2. We suggest that you spend around an 1 hour on the basic application to fulfil the requirements. If you want to spend more time and embellish your application, then let us know approximately how long you spent.
3. You can use any internet resources or tools available to you: we are not interested in how well you can memorise standard library features.

# Hints

1. The programming is more important than the true randomness of the results - random numbers is a whole field in itself and, although very interesting, that is not the point of the exercise!
2. Use comments and pseudocode to describe things you would do with more time.

# Requirements

1. The program shall choose 6 numbers for the user.
2. The 6 numbers shall be unique. For example {8, 10, 15, 28, 35, 43} is okay {8, 10, 15, 28, 43, 43} is not.
3. The numbers shall be presented to the user in numerical order.
4. The numbers shall be in the range of 1 to 49 inclusive.
5. The application shall be written in any language or languages.
6. The application shall be any form of application so long as it has a UI, for example a console application, desktop application, web page, a phone app.
7. EXTRA: The numbers shall have a different coloured background: 1-9 grey, 10-19 blue, 20-29, pink, 30-39 green, 40-49 yellow.
8. EXTRA: The program shall provide a bonus ball drawn after the original 6.
